## Description

TODOit is a clean, intuitive todo list application that helps you organize your tasks without compromising your privacy. Everything stays on your device - no accounts, no sign-ups, no data collection.
- Install as Progressive Web App via https://todoit.pages.dev/
- Install as Microsoft/Desktop App via https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NH3HZDSS3X6

## Features

- Main Task with optional due date, remarks and even sub-task.
- Editing/Adding sub-task on an existing task item.
- Sub-Task can be check/uncheck indivually.
- **Theme Toggle** - for Light Mode (default) and Dark Mode.
- **Export** - for exporting your current task as .json file.
- **Import** - for importing your existing/previous task in a .json file.

## Notes

<a href="https://todoit.pages.dev">TODOit</a> only uses Local Storage, clearing browser/app data will also clear all your task. Please use the Export button to save your progress (and back it up anywhere safe) - _if you ever want to uninstall the app (for whatever reason)_, then use the import button to restore it. Backup (.json) file will work on every device that supports the app. Online/Cloud synchronization are not yet supported, but still on slight consideration.
